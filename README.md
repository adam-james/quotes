# Quotes

A simple application for tracking quotes. Built using React, Apollo, and Graphcool.

This was a first learning experiment in creating a CRUD app with GraphQL and Apollo.
All and all I'd say it was a success. I was able to complete in a little over a week
thanks to the Developer Experience provided by Graphcool, the Apollo client and GraphQL.
Most of my time was spent styling and refactoring Apollo code for readability, reuse,
and maintainability.
